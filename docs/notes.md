-   Sort words by frequency index, i.e., words most likely to give good clues
    -   Rationale:
        -   The word frequency index is the sum of the frequencies of the *unique* letters in a word
        -   Since the letters in the words appear in the most other words, they are the most likely to give hints about whatever word happens to be the correct one
